#Workspace Manager C version 0.1.0 for Symphony CMS 3.0+

Workspace Manager C for Symphony 3 allows files in the Workspace folder to be managed and edited. It also restores the ability to access Page XSL templates from `Blueprints->Pages`.

##Installation

The folder needs to be named "workspace\_manager\_c". Install in the usual way for a Symphony extension.

##Usage

Mostly self evident. On the editor page, files can be saved using `Ctrl + s` or `Cmd + s` when the browser's focus is on the editing area.

##Browser Compatibility.

Workspace Manager C will not work fully on Internet Explorer version 9 or lower.
